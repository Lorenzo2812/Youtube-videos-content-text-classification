The project is about Natural language processing and deals with a multi-class text classification 
task: text data is categorized in 4 topics. The project follows the following steps:

• Importing data and visualization of useful plots

• Data pre_processing

• Base models: bidirectional LSTM model and bidirectional GRU model

• Meta-model, taking as input the predictions of the best bidirectional LSTM model and the 
best bidirectional GRU model

• Benchmark model: pre-trained BERT model
